# Jsh

</div>

## Philosophy

**Pure shell, no frameworks** - Everything runs in bash/zsh with no external dependencies. No Python, Ruby, or Node required for core functionality.

**Graceful degradation** - Modern tools (fzf, eza, fd, bat, ripgrep) enhance the experience when available, but nothing breaks without them.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jovalle/.jsh ~/.jsh
~/.jsh/jsh setup
```

## Credits

Greatly enhanced with [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) and an assortment of Zsh plugins.
